Harris,Ross - Beginning Algorithms 

J2SE, JUnit, Eclipse

Project is based on book cited upper. It's its my own implementation of Data Structures like : ArrayList,LinkedList,Set,Map and Algorithms like QuickSort, ShellSort, BinarySearch.

I've learned here one of Agile methodology which is : Test-Driven Delevopment.

Every Class is made in same instructions :

1. Make JUnit test. Test all functionality that your Class should have. Test all method's which in fact doesn't exist's.
2. Make desired Class or Package.
3. Test until your Class will pass all JUnit test's.
